I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)](https://engineering.buffalo.edu/computer-science-engineering.html) 
at the [University at Buffalo, SUNY](https://www.buffalo.edu/). I am leading the [NExt-generation MObile-network (NEMO) lab]({% link _pages/profiles.md %}) @ UB.

Before joining UB, I was a postdoctoral research associate at Princeton University,
working with Prof. Kyle Jamieson and Prof. Jennifer Rexford. 
I received my Ph.D. from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), 
under supervision of Prof. Mo Li.

I am the author of two open-source research tool: Atheros-CSI-Tool and NG-Scope.
