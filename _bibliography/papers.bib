		abstract = {We present the design and implementation of WaveFlex, the first smart surface that enhances Private 5G networks operating under the shared-license framework in the Citizens Broadband Radio Service frequency band. WaveFlex works in the presence of frequency diversity: multiple nearby base stations operating on different frequencies, as dictated by a Spectrum Access System coordinator. It also handles time dynamism: due to the dynamic sharing rules of the CBRS band, base stations occasionally switch channels, especially when priority users enter the network. Finally, WaveFlex operates independently of the network itself, not requiring access to nor modification of the gNB or UEs, yet it remains compliant with and effective on prevailing cellular protocols. We have designed and fabricated WaveFlex on a custom multi-layer PCB, software defined radio based network monitor, and supporting control software and hardware. Our experimental evaluation benchmarks operational Private 5G and LTE networks running at full line rate. In a realistic indoor office scenario, 5G experimental results demonstrate an 8.58~dB average SNR gain, and an average throughput gain of 10.77 Mbps under a single gNB, and 12.84 Mbps under three gNBs, corresponding to throughput improvements of 18.4\% and 19.5\%, respectively.},

Malicious actors could exploit vulnerabilities to hijack or deploy rogue RIS, transforming them from communication boosters into attackers. We present a novel attack that disrupts the critical orthogonality property of OFDM subcarriers, severely degrading communication performance. This attack is achieved by manipulating the RIS to generate frequency-shifted reflections/harmonics of the original OFDM signal. We also propose algorithms to simultaneously beamform the multiple RIS-generated frequency-shifted reflections towards selected targets. Extensive experiments conducted in indoor, outdoor, 3D, and office settings demonstrate that Hydra can achieve a 90\% throughput reduction in targeted attack scenarios and a 43\% throughput reduction in indiscriminate attack scenarios. Furthermore, we validated the effectiveness of our attacks on both the 802.11 protocol and the 5G NR protocol.},

		abstract = {The majority of existing Wi-Fi backscatter systems transmit tag data at rates lower than 250 kbps, as the tag data is modulated at OFDM symbol level, allowing for demodulation using commercial Wi-Fi receivers. However, it is necessary to modulate tag data at OFDM sample level to satisfy the requirements for higher throughput. A comprehensive theoretical analysis and experimental investigation conducted in this paper demonstrates that demodulating sample-level modulated tag data using commercial Wi-Fi receivers is unattainable due to excessive computational overhead and demodulation errors. This is because the significant tag information dispersion, loss, and shuffling are caused by Wi-Fi physical layer operations. We conclude that the optimal position for demodulation is the time-domain IQ samples, which do not undergo any Wi-Fi physical layer operations and preserve the intact, ordered, and undispersed information of tag-modulated data, thereby minimizing complexity and maximizing accuracy.We devise a demodulation algorithm using time domain IQ samples and implement on two types of demodulator: a dual radio chain demodulator and a single radio chain demodulator. Experiments show that our demodulation algorithm not only decrease the BER by at least three orders of magnitude, but also reduces the time complexity from exponential to linear. It achieves a tag data rate of up to 10 Mbps with QPSK modulation and a BER at 10-4 for the dual radio chain demodulator, and a tag data rate of up to 1 Mbps with BPSK and a BER at 10-4 for the single radio demodulator. We believe our results pave the way for designing Wi-Fi backscatter system with extremely high throughput.},

Addressing the limitations of existing approaches, which struggle with the diversity of pesticide compounds, portability issues, and environmental sensitivity, this paper introduces Hornbill. A wireless and battery-free electrochemical bio-tag that integrates the advantages of NFC technology with electrochemical biosensors for portable, precise, and touchless multi-pesticide detection. The basic idea of Hornbill is comparing the distinct electrochemical responses between a pair of biological receptors and different pesticides to construct a unique set of feature fingerprints to make multi-pesticide sensing feasible. To incorporate this idea within small NFC tags, we reengineer the electrochemical sensor, spanning the antenna to the voltage regulator. Additionally, to improve the system's sensitivity and environmental robustness, we carefully design the electrodes by combining microelectrode technology and materials science. Experiments with 9 different pesticides show that Hornbill achieves a mean accuracy of 93\% in different concentration environments and its sensitivity and robustness surpass that of commercial electrochemical sensors.},

This paper proposes an acoustic-based facial recognition system based on acoustic facial spectrum - a novel acoustic representation of human faces in 3D space. Specifically, we divide the 3D space into cubes and profile the distribution of the acoustic signal reflected by the human face inside each cube. Generating such a per-cube acoustic profile is challenging in relating each reflected signal path back to the physical location of its reflecting cube. To address the challenge, we propose a novel multipath resolving algorithm that is capable of distinguishing signal reflection happened within different cube. Based on the facial spectrum, we propose a discriminator-recognizer network that can robustly recognize human faces under varying face-microphone distances or even in presence of facial mask blockage. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves over 95\% average recognition accuracy for cases with and without mask blockage.

		abstract = {Diverse Wi-Fi-based wireless applications have been proposed, ranging from daily activity recognition to vital sign monitoring. Despite their remarkable sensing accuracy, the high energy consumption and the requirement for customized hardware modification hinder the wide deployment of the existing sensing solutions. In this paper, we propose REHSense, an energy-efficient wireless sensing solution based on Radio-Frequency (RF) energy harvesting. Instead of relying on a power-hungry Wi-Fi receiver, REHSense leverages an RF energy harvester as the sensor and utilizes the voltage signals harvested from the ambient Wi-Fi signals to enable simultaneous context sensing and energy harvesting. We design and implement REHSense using a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) RF energy harvester. Extensive evaluation of three fine-grained wireless sensing tasks (i.e., respiration monitoring, human activity recognition, and hand gesture recognition) shows that REHSense can achieve comparable sensing accuracy with conventional Wi-Fi-based solutions while adapting to different sensing environments, reducing the power consumption of sensing by 98.7\% and harvesting up to 4.5 mW of power from RF energy.},

With the insights we glean from an in-the-wild TikTok performance study and a user study focused on swipe patterns, Dashlet proposes a novel out-of-order video chunk pre-buffering mechanism that leverages a simple, non machine learning-based model of users' swipe statistics to determine the pre-buffering order and bitrate.

In this paper, we propose RF-Bouncer, a compact, low-cost, simple-structure programmable dual-band metasurface that supports concurrent beamforming on two Sub-6 ISM bands. By configuring the states of the meta-atoms, the metasurface is able to simultaneously steer the incident signals from two bands towards their desired departure angles. We fabricate the metasurface and validate its performance via extensive experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that RF-Bouncer achieves 15.4 dB average signal strength improvement and a 2.49× throughput improvement even with a relatively small 16× 16 array of meta-atoms.},

NG-Scope handles the latest cellular innovations, such as when multiple base stations aggregate their signals together to serve mobile users. End-to-end experiments in a commercial cellular network demonstrate that wireless capacity varies significantly with channel quality, mobility, competing traffic within each cell, and the number of aggregated cells. Our experiments demonstrate significantly improved cell load estimation accuracy, missing the detection of less than 1\% of data capacity overall, a reduction of 82\% compared to OWL, the state-of-the-art in cellular monitoring.

Traditional methods mainly use intrusive EOG sensors or cameras to capture eye activity information. In this work, we propose a system named SmartLens to achieve eye activity sensing using zero-power contact lens. To make it happen, we develop dedicated antenna design which can be fitted in an extremely small space and still work efficiently to reach a working distance more than 1 m. To accurately track eye movements in the presence of strong self-interference, we employ another tag to track the user's head movement and cancel it out to support sensing a walking or moving user. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system. At a distance of 1.4 m, the proposed system can achieve an average accuracy of detecting the basic eye movement and blink at 89.63\% and 82\%, respectively.},
